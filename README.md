# Cpp_Doubly_Linked_List
List implementation and practice

1. Sort list with selection sort. 
2. `N` grey and `M` white mice are in the circle. Cat rounds circle clockwise and eats each `s` mice.
	 Count starts with a grey mouse. Determine initial order of mice in circle if some time later `K` grey and `L` white mice are left.
	 Grey - `1`, white - `0`.
3. Change every element in `n*m` matrix to the next closest biggest element. Change to zero if no such element.
